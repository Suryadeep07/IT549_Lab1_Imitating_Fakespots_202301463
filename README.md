Task 3 Word Cloud generation
Interpretion of the observed patterns:

When I looked at the word clouds for the fake reviews, I noticed a clear pattern. Words like "love", "great", "good", "nice", and "best" appear very frequently across almost all categories. So does category related words like "dog" for the pet supplies, "book" for kindle and so on. 

Why does this indicate fake reviews?
---> They may look normal, but also feel redundant and "bot like". These terms likely show up because the reviews are computer-generated or written by people who haven't actually used the product. Since they can't write about specific details or real experiences, they just use generic, overly positive words to make the review look good. Real reviews should talk about specific features or problems, but these fake ones just repeat the same general praise.
